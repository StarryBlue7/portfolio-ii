# Professional Portfolio Page

This is my professional portfolio website. It displays my portfolio of coding and design work, while also showcasing my skills for CSS/HTML styling, and graphic design sensibilities. There are also links to my CV and various contact methods.

### Dynamic Scaling

This page scales content and the content proportion of the screen to ideally utilize the space of various screen sizes. Additionally, the navigation bar at the top will reorganize itself into an even rows when the viewport width is narrow enough that the row must wrap.

### Particles.js Background

Utilizing Vincent Garreau's Particles.js library, a dynamic constellation background is generated for a minimally disruptive aesthetic.
